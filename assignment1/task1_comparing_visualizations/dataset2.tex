\section{Anime Dataset}

{\bf Attributes:} Rank, Name, Japanese\_name, Type, Episodes, Studio, Release\_season, Tags, Rating, Release\_year, End\_year, Description, Content\_Warning, Related\_Mange, Related\_anime, Voice\_actors, staff\\

{\bf Scenario:}  A streaming service is considering expanding its short anime series catalog ($<$ 25 episodes) and wants to understand how viewer ratings differ between anime TV series and movies released after 2015. The goal is to determine which format generally receives better audience reception to inform licensing and promotion strategies.\\

{\bf Research Question:} How do audience ratings compare between anime TV series and movies released after 2015, and which format generally receives higher ratings?

\subsection{Part A: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing}
First, filter your dataset so that only the variables critical for your analysis remain. Then clean your data so that there is consistency in variable types, capitalization, and handle any missing or invalid values.\\
-----\\
We first filtered by Year to keep everything released after 2015, then removed all of the columns irrelevant to the research question, leaving 'Type' and 'Rating'. After doing a drop of all rows with missing values and renaming the columns so they are consistent to how the albums data was set up, there was much whitespace left in the attribute values of the type column, so that was stripped away. \\

At that point we could force all of the type values to lowercase and read out a dictionary to ensure that there were not any misspelling concerns. Below is the corresponding utility function:\\
 
\begin{verbatim}
def clean_preprocess_anime_data(input_csv: str, output_csv: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Cleans and preprocesses the anime dataset by filtering out the irrelevant features
    and datapoints and reformatting the columns names and attribute values

    :param input_csv:: Path to the input CSV file containing the anime dataset.
    :type input_csv: str
    :param output_csv: Filename for the clean data.
    :type output_csv: str
    :returns: pd.DataFrame
    :rtype: pd.DataFrame
    """
    df = pd.read_csv(input_csv)

    # Keeps relevant variables, relevant data poitns, removes the
    # missing value rows, renames the columns, and strips the whitespace
    # out for the type col
    df = df[df['Release_year'] > 2015]
    df = df.loc[:, ['Type', 'Rating']]
    df.dropna(inplace=True)
    df.columns = ['type', 'rating']
    df['type'] = df['type'].str.strip()

    # Standardizes to lower case and filters out irrelevant types
    df['type'] = df['type'].str.lower()
    df = df[df['type'].isin(['tv', 'movie'])]
    print(df['type'].value_counts().to_dict())

    os.makedirs(f'../datasets/clean/', exist_ok=True)
    df.to_csv(f'../datasets/clean/{output_csv}', index=False)
    return df

\subsection{Part B: Generate Three Visualizations}
Produce the following types of plots:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Error Bar Plot:} Show the mean and variability (e.g., standard error or 95\% confidence intervals) of the numerical variable across each category.
    \item \textbf{Barcode Chart:} Also known as a strip plot or rug plot. Shows individual data points across categories.
    \item \textbf{Histogram:} Plot the distribution of the numerical variable, grouped by the categorical variable (using hue or facet).

\subsection{Part C: Evaluate and Justify Visualization}
For the dataset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each visualization type.
    \item Decide which visualization is best for the research question.
    \item Support your answer with evidence from the plots and reasoning based on dataset size, shape, or structure.
