\section*{Context}
In data science, the choice of visualization plays a critical role in shaping how insights are derived and communicated. Different visual encodings can highlight or obscure structure in data â€” including spread, skew, outliers, modality, or differences between categories. In this task, you will explore how three different types of visualizations can be used to compare distributions across categories, and evaluate which is most appropriate depending on the dataset context.\\

For this task, you are provided with three datasets, each containing categorical grouping variables and a numerical measurement. Each dataset comes with a research scenario/question. Your task is to clean the data, visualize the distribution across categories using multiple plotting techniques, and discuss which visualization is the most appropriate in addressing the research question for each dataset.
